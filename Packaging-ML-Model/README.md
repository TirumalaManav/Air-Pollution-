Air Pollution Prediction Using LSTM Model
Overview
The Air Pollution Prediction project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict air pollution levels based on historical data. This project aims to provide accurate forecasting of air quality, which is crucial for environmental monitoring, policy-making, and public health.

Features
LSTM-Based Forecasting: Utilizes LSTM networks for accurate time-series predictions of air pollution levels.
Data Handling: Processes and analyzes air quality data, including cleaning and feature extraction.
Visualization: Generates visualizations to compare predicted and actual pollution levels, aiding in model evaluation and interpretation.
Model Training and Evaluation: Includes training of the LSTM model, evaluation metrics, and performance assessment.
Pipeline Integration: Incorporates training and prediction pipelines to streamline model training and deployment.

Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:


git clone https://github.com/TirumalaManav/Air-Pollution-<REPO>
Navigate to the Project Directory:


cd Air-Pollution-Forecasting
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train the model using the training pipeline, run:
python prediction_model/training_pipeline.py

To make predictions, use:

python prediction_model/pipeline.py
Testing
Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:


pytest
Configuration
Configuration parameters are specified in the config.py file. Update this file as needed for different datasets or model settings.

Data
Datasets: The project includes historical air quality data in prediction_model/datasets/air_quality_data.csv.
Model: Trained models are saved in prediction_model/trained_models/.
Visualization
The project generates a plot comparing predicted and actual pollution levels. The plot is saved as prediction_vs_actual.png in the current directory.
